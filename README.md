# `QUIC` vs `TCP` performance measurement tools

This project aims at providing a **performance comparison** between `TCP` and the newer `QUIC` protocol of the *Transport* layer.

## Getting started

### Install

> Make sure to have [Go](https://golang.org/) installed and environment variables setup correctly. Check by calling `go version` from the command line, which should output something like `go version go1.12 windows/amd64
` depending on your OS and Go version. If the command `go` is not found, check your installation or install it (if you haven't yet) from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

First and foremost you'll have to fetch all needed dependencies of the project. Simply run `go get` from the command line.

### Build

Before obtaining a runnable executable file you'll have to run `go build main.go` to build the program.
A `main.exe` file will be created right next to the `main.go` file in the root of the repository.

Try executing it from the command line: `main.exe` or `main` on the command line!
